# Ghostly Escape Maze Game #

## Overview ##

### Concept ###
This project was based on the idea of puzzles because when I was kid, I thought puzzles were fun since it helped develop critical thinking. I got my inspiration from the Pac-Man arcade video game, a Japanese video game created by Toru Iwatani. The idea of how a maze is like a person’s life and our demons keep coming after us so we need to find a way to get out.

In the game, players will come to a dark purple screen titled the name of the game “Ghostly Escape Maze” where it will have two pastel red buttons. The buttons will say “Start” and “Info” as the beginning of the screen that introduces the game. The “Start” button will start the game and will randomize the different maze routes. The “Info” button will be a link to the artist statement, plus more about this game and how the rules of the game works.
The main game screen will have clouds opening up to a maze filled with green bushes/trees/yellow hay creating the passageways to get through the maze. There will be a pause button, stop button, info button, sound button, the name of the game on top of the screen, and have: a timer and three lives. The setting will be cute, but also evil because this game is supposed to be about escaping the demons. There will be some other items added to help the player get through the maze and escape from the ghosts/demons. The game will end when the player wins the game, stops the game, or if the ghost catches the player. When the player is caught, they will only have three lives to continue where they got caught and stay on the score. However, if they get caught the third time, then the game will officially end and will have to try again. The player can only win if they can either catch as many items as they can to survive or they get out of the maze within a shorter time span.

The end game screen will show a dark purple screen with red words saying “Game Over” and there will be a blue button that says “Try Again”. Meaning the player can try the game again and the button will randomize another maze for the player to go through.


### Software ###
This project runs on html, css, [p.5.js](https://p5js.org/), and uses the [p5.play](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) library.

## Timeline ##
> Coding Overall Functionality
  * Title Screen:
  - Title
  - Start button (randomize a maze layout)
  * Game Screen:
  - WASD/Arrow movement
  - Ghost figure follows the player as they try to escape the maze
  - Pause button
  - Stop button
  - Name of game on top of screen
  - Timer to show how long it took to finish the maze
  - Three lives (maybe - to resurrect at the same spot the player gets caught)

> Making & Implementing Assets/Art
  - Adding in animated figures/characters
    - Ghost (white)
    - Little player figure
    - Maze layout(s)
> Debugging & Testing Software
  - Test & Debug after every code to make sure it is working properly
> Additional Features & Finishing Touches
  - Maybe add some transparent clouds surrounding the maze to make it spooky
  - Sound button (if applicable - on every screen)
  - Info button (main, game, & end screen) - link to artist statement & directions on how to play the game

Work on the game every week -->
Finish everything by April 27th, 2022
